<h3 align="center">Health Care Analysis with PySpark</h3>

- ðŸ”­ Healthcare analysis plays a crucial role in understanding prescription patterns and optimizing healthcare delivery. In this PySpark project, we focus on analyzing city and prescriber data to gain insights into prescription practices across different cities and states in the USA

<h4 align="left"><strong>Objectives</strong></h4>
The objective of this project is to analyze city and prescriber data to gain insights into prescription practices across different cities. By leveraging PySpark, we aim to preprocess the data, apply various transformations, and load the transformed data into Databricks tables. Additionally, we will build a report in Power BI to visualize the findings.
